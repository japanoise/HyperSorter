	v1.0.0 - Initial release

	A minimum viable product.  It's way better than any previous
	attempt I've made at this type of program, but there are some
	possible future avenues for development:

	* TODO: A better config file format (null-separated strings is
	lazy programmer garbage)
	* TODO: More config options - store the usage of scale mode in the
	config file, for example.
	* TODO: Full CRUD of directory entries
